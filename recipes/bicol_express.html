            <h3>What's for dinner tonight? It is one of Pinoy's Favorite Food!!</h3>
            <p>The mild sweetness of coconut milk brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of chili pepper and <br>
                bagoong in the classic <strong><em>Bicol Express</strong></em> recipe. This contrast has long created a spell-binding richness <br>
                in taste for the dish. And this has helped make it arguably one of the most popular Filipino dishes.</p>
